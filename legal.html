Introduction</p>

<p>Tesla, Inc. and its affiliates (“Tesla”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy explains Tesla’s policies and procedures regarding information we collect from or about our customers and their use of our products and services. Tesla intends to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information that we collect. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. By providing information to us or by using our products or services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Information We May Collect</p>

<p>We collect three main types of information related to you or your use of our products and services: (1) information from or about you or your devices; (2) information from or about your Tesla vehicle; and (3) information from or about your Tesla energy products. Depending on the Tesla products and services you request, own, or use, not all of these types of information may be applicable to you.</p>

<p>From or about you or your devices</p>
<p>We may collect information from or about you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail, payment information, etc.) or your devices in a variety of ways, including:</p>

<p>Through the Services: We may collect information from or about you through our websites, software applications, social media pages, e-mail messages, or other digital services (the “Services”), e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or register your product with us.
From other sources: We also may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, certified installers, third-party vehicle repair or service centers, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>Tesla Account: Customers who purchase certain Tesla products will receive a Tesla Account, which is hosted on our website. We may collect and process the following types of data for your Tesla Account that you elect to provide to us: your customer registration information; the status of your order; warranty and other documentation for your Tesla products; and general information about your Tesla products (including, for example, vehicle identification number or other product serial number, service plan information, or connectivity package), insurance forms, driver’s licenses, financing agreements, and similar information. You can access your Tesla Account to update the information from or about you in that account at any time.</p>
<p>Offline: We may collect information from or about you offline, such as when you visit a Tesla store or repair facility, attend one of our events, sign up for a test drive, place an order over the phone, or contact our customer services or sales department.
Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Services (such as the Tesla App) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</p>
